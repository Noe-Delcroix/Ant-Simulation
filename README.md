# Ant Simulation

A little program that aims to simulate the real life behaviors of ants going out of their nest and looking for food to bring back to the colony.

## How to use :

You can place/remove obstacles on the terrain by press the left/right mouse button.
If you click the middle mouse button, you'll place little green dots : they represent food the ants are trying to find
Once you're happy with the environment you've created, you can press N to place a new ant colony?
The ants with come out of the nest and start to bring back the food.
You can see the ant's pheromones (the thing they use to communicate to each other) by pressing the right mouse button.

This project runs on Processing : https://processing.org/
